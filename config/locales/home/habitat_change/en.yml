      title: How are habitats changing?

        - Globally, coastal and marine habitats are in decline because of numerous threats, including coastal development, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Nearly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/03_SROCC_SPM_FINAL.pdf" title=" Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) - Summary for Policymakers" target="_blank">50% of coastal wetlands have been lost</a> over the last 100 years, with up to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/03_SROCC_SPM_FINAL.pdf" title=" Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) - Summary for Policymakers" target="_blank">90% of remaining wetlands</a> projected to be lost by 2100. Approximately <a href="https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/ipbes_7_10_add.1_en_1.pdf?file=1&id=35329&type=node" title="Report of the Plenary of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services on the work of its seventh session" target="_blank">50% of live coral cover has been lost</a> since the 1870s, and climate change and other drivers have led to accelerated losses in recent decades. Almost <a href="https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/ipbes_7_10_add.1_en_1.pdf?file=1&id=35329&type=node" title="Report of the Plenary of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services on the work of its seventh session" target="_blank">30% of known seagrass area across the globe has been lost</a> due to human activities, and at least 22 of the world’s 72 seagrass species are in decline.

        - Despite current trends, there is hope. The <a href="https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/" title="UN Decade on Exosystem Restoration" target="_blank">UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030)</a> offers the international community an opportunity to work together to reverse ecosystem fragmentation and degradation, helping to restore the critical ecosystems that humans and biodiversity alike depend on for survival. A recent flagship <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/ecosystem-restoration-people-nature-climate" target="_blank">UNEP report</a> estimates that carefully planned and targeted restoration could help to avoid 60 per cent of expected biodiversity extinctions. To achieve this, the world must deliver on its current commitment to restore at least one billion hectares (an area about the size of China) of degraded land in the next decade, in which marine and coastal areas will play a major role.
