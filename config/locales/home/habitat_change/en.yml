      title: How are habitats changing?

        - Globally, coastal and marine habitats are in decline, impacted by coastal development, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Nearly <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/03_SROCC_SPM_FINAL.pdf" title=" Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) - Summary for Policymakers" target="_blank">50% of coastal wetlands have been lost</a> over the last 100 years, with <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/03_SROCC_SPM_FINAL.pdf" title=" Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) - Summary for Policymakers" target="_blank">20 - 90% of remaining wetlands</a> projected to be lost by 2100.

Seagrass meadows have decreased in extent by over <a href="https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/ipbes_7_10_add.1_en_1.pdf?file=1&id=35329&type=node" title="Report of the Plenary of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services on the work of its seventh session" target="_blank">10% per decade between 1970 and 2000</a>.

        - While our knowledge of ecosystem health globally is still relatively limited, the species that comprise these habitats are assessed through <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/" title="IUCN Red List" target="_blank">the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a>, with an emerging IUCN Red List of Ecosystems.
        - Despite current trends, there is hope. The <a href="https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/" title="UN Decade on Exosystem Restoration" target="_blank">UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030)</a> offers the international community an opportunity to work together to reverse ecosystem fragmentation and degradation, helping to restore the critical ecosystems that humans and biodiversity alike depend on for survival.
