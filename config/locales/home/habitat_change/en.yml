      title: How are habitats changing?
      text_1:
        - Globally, coastal and marine habitats are in decline, impacted by coastal development, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Approximately 50% of live coral cover has been lost since the 1870s, and climate change and other drivers have led to accelerated losses in recent decades [ref]. Seagrass meadows have decreased in extent by over 10% per decade between 1970 and 2000 [ref]. 
        - While our knowledge of ecosystem health globally is still relatively limited, the species that comprise these habitats are assessed through the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species [ref], with an emerging IUCN Red List of Ecosystems [ref].
        - Despite current trends, there is hope. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) offers the international community an opportunity to work together to reverse ecosystem fragmentation and degradation, helping to restore the critical ecosystems that humans and biodiversity alike depend on for survival.
