      title: Are we protecting habitats?
      text_1: As of 2021, less than <a href="https://wcmc.io/mpas" title="Protected Planet - Marine Protected Areas" target="_blank">8% of the ocean</a> is covered by protected areas and <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/c/other-effective-area-based-conservation-measures" title="Protected Planet - Other effective area based conservation measures" target="_blank">other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs)</a>. These other measures may include areas where conservation is an outcome but not a stated objective, such as some war graves or protected shipwrecks.
      text_2: In the case of both protected areas and OECMs, the <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/resources/mpa-guide" title="Marine Protected Areas guide" target="_blank">level of protection</a> they afford to marine and coastal habitats varies, as does the degree to which they are <a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/protected-areas-management-effectiveness-pame?tab=Results" title="Global Database on Protected Area Management Effectiveness" target="_blank">effectively governed and managed</a>. However, coverage is not equally distributed across the ocean. Although protected areas and OECMs now cover 18.01% within national waters, coverage in areas beyond national jurisdiction lags behind at 1.18%.
