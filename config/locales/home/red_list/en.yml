      title: Global species composition and status by habitat
      intro_text: 
        - While our knowledge of ecosystem health globally is still relatively limited, many of the species that comprise these habitats have been assessed through the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/" title="Visit the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species site" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a>, which assesses the global extinction risk status of species. These assessments help to prioritize which species need conservation attention and protection more urgently. Accurately estimating how many species are endangered can further helps countries understand the resiliency of their ecosystems.
        - The table below shows the number of habitat-forming species within each habitat group by their global IUCN Red List status, also illustrating the total number of species assessed globally for each group. Habitat-forming species support diverse life by providing shelter or feeding grounds for other species, and thereby play an important role in the functioning of an ecosystem.
        - While most warm-water corals, mangroves and seagrasses have been assessed by the IUCN Red List team, there are still many species of saltmarshes and cold-water corals that have not yet been assessed, with a “Not Evaluated” status.
