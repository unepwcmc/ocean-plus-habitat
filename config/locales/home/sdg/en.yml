      title: How do habitats contribute to human wellbeing?
      text_1: 
        - Habitats such as coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves generate sources of nutrition through fish, provide protection to coastal communities from storms, and contribute to local economies through tourism and resource provision. They also help to regulate our water and air, with far-reaching benefits for even inland communities. 
        - These habitats are not only important for local communities, but also collectively form the foundations of national, regional and international progress toward targets related to human wellbeing, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Targets. These can be explored further in the graphic below.

          description: "Globally, more than half the income of poor rural households comes from nature, and healthy ocean ecosystems provide food, fuel, and other crucial benefits that alleviate poverty directly. Coastal habitats support subsistence aquaculture, fisheries and tourism, providing livelihoods and direct income into the local economy. Many coastal habitats, such as mangroves and coral reefs, are key tourist destinations, that provide rich biodiversity that visitors can experience and benefit from."
