      title: How do habitats contribute to human wellbeing?
      text_1: 
        - Habitats such as coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves generate sources of nutrition through fish, provide protection to coastal communities from storms, and contribute to local economies through tourism. 
        - Ocean habitats are not only important to local communities, but also collectively form the foundations of national, regional and international progress toward targets related to human wellbeing.

          description: "Biodiversity supports a range of economic activities. In particular, subsistence agriculture and fisheries provide livelihoods for many of the world’s rural poor. Protected areas in several countries are already expected to report on their contribution to poverty reduction targets and there is growing pressure to ensure that protected areas contribute to supporting the livelihoods of the more socially and economically vulnerable."

          description: "All food systems depend on biodiversity and ecosystem services that support agricultural productivity, soil fertility, and water quality and supply. By protecting these key ecosystem services, protected areas can contribute to enhance food security. Protected areas also provide basic supporting services such as soil production and stabilisation of water supplies, as well as buffering against extreme climatic events."

          description: "The link between biodiversity and human health is increasingly recognized. By protecting ecosystems, protected areas help mitigate the spread and impact of pollution. For instance, protecting forests help regulate water flow and improve water quality. Medicines are also be derived from biodiversity. Finally, by offering recreational opportunities, protected areas also contribute to enhancing physical and mental well-being."

          description: "Raising awareness of the importance of protecting biodiversity for sustainable development, notably through the creation of protected areas and other conservation measures, will be key to achieving this and other SDGs. In particular, protected areas located close to urban centres can provide basic knowledge on the importance of ecosystem functioning."

          description: "Women are often the primary users of natural resources and play a key role in their management. However, they often do not have ownership and control over land and resources and they tend to be disproportionally affected by the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, if empowered, they can contribute to the sustainability of resource use. For instance, if protected areas are equitably managed, they can help reducing gender inequalities."

          description: "The delivery of water supplies and water quality require healthy ecosystems, which can also help prevent water-related hazards and disasters. Protected areas provide a significant proportion of the drinking water for many of the world’s largest cities. Protection of water towers, cloud forests, forested catchments for water, and natural floodplains is therefore essential to ensure freshwater supply and reduce disaster risks."

          description: "Biodiversity supports the provision of ecosystem services which are key to almost all economic activities. By preserving ecosystem functions, protected areas can lead to higher productivity and more efficient resource use. They can also offer opportunities for business development, especially in rural and remote areas. Nature tourism, including visits to protected areas, is one of the fastest-growing sectors."

For instance, coral reefs and mangrove forests protect coasts against flooding that are expected to increase with climate change. It is therefore particularly important for these areas to be protected."

          description: "Larger income inequality within countries have been shown to be related to greater biodiversity loss. In recent years, there has been a significant shift from protected areas solely managed by governments to protected areas managed by indigenous and local communities, or under shared governance. Increasing the recognition of the role of indigenous and local people in protected area management will contribute to reducing inequalities."

          description: "The global urban population is expected to reach 5 billion by 2030. Ecosystems and biodiversity deliver all the basic services that enable human production, consumption and habitation, such as protection from extreme weather events. Urban planning that integrates biodiversity, for instance through the creation of urban parks, can provide important buffers for urban centres and contribute to more sustainable cities."

          description: "Consumption and production of all goods and services rely on the use of natural resources, which in turn impacts biodiversity. Unsustainable consumption patterns can undermine the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. Supporting local communities, especially the ones living in and around protected areas, is necessary to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources."

          description: "Species and ecosystems are already being impacted by climate change. It is therefore crucial to protect them, not only to preserve biodiversity, but also their capacity to contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation. Indeed, many natural ecosystems provide globally significant carbon stores, and healthy ecosystems are key to enhance resilience to climate change, for instance by acting as natural buffers against extreme climatic events."

          description: "Marine protected areas contribute directly to this goal. The conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in marine and coastal ecosystems is key to sustainable development. Biodiversity indeed underpins all fishing and aquaculture activities. Protecting marine and coastal areas is thus essential to ensure that the world’s oceans, seas and marine resources are preserved."

          description: "Terrestrial protected areas contribute directly to this goal. Although there has been a marked increase in protected area coverage, many areas important for biodiversity are still not adequately protected. The designation of protected areas has played a crucial role in preventing deforestation and is likely to have contributed to the conservation of several vertebrate species. Protected areas are thus key to protect terrestrial habitats, species, and ecosystem services."

The SDGs and the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity are therefore mutually supportive and reinforcing."
