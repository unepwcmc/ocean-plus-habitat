      title: How do habitats contribute to human wellbeing?
      text_1: 
        - Habitats such as coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves generate sources of nutrition through fish, provide protection to coastal communities from storms, and contribute to local economies through tourism and resource provision. They also help to regulate our water and air, with far-reaching benefits for even inland communities. 
        - These habitats are not only important for local communities, but also collectively form the foundations of national, regional and international progress toward targets related to human wellbeing, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Targets. These can be explored further in the graphic below.

          description: "Globally, more than half the income of poor rural households comes from nature, and healthy ocean ecosystems provide food, fuel, and other crucial benefits that alleviate poverty directly. Coastal habitats support subsistence aquaculture, fisheries and tourism, providing livelihoods and direct income into the local economy. Many coastal habitats, such as mangroves and coral reefs, are key tourist destinations, that provide rich biodiversity that visitors can experience and benefit from."

          description: "Many coastal ecosystems, such as seagrasses, mangroves and coral reefs, provide vital breeding and nursery grounds, in which nutritionally and economically important fish and invertebrate species can thrive. Sustainable management of these ecosystems can thus help to boost and protect sources of nutrition to coastal populations to reduce hunger."

          description: "Coastal and marine ecosystems provide many traditional and novel medicines for pain, cancer and other diseases. Seagrasses and mangroves filter out pollutants to improve water quality and support cleaner marine environments. Mangroves also provide nursery grounds for important sources of nutrition and wood for cooking and heating. Moreover, coastal habitats offer recreational opportunities that may enhance physical and mental well-being."

          description: "Understanding the ocean’s influence on people, as well as people’s influence on the ocean is known as ‘Ocean Literacy’. First-hand experiences of coastal habitats have been proven to enhance learning ocean users and non-users. ‘Hands-on’ experiences can be used to demonstrate our relationship with nature and improve understanding of healthy ecosystem functioning and drivers of change."

          description: "In many coastal areas, women play a vital role in ecosystem management (including mangrove reforestation and restoration), onshore fisheries, aquaculture and resource harvesting. Gender-responsive projects focusing on integrated coastal zone management have helped to empower women in a number of areas to improve sustainable resource management, reduce poverty and inequality, and protect important habitats such as mangroves, corals and seagrasses."

          icon: 'icons/sdg-goal-06.png'
          description: "Healthy marine and coastal ecosystems are required to deliver clean water. Mangrove, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats trap and filter dissolved nutrients, sediments and pollutants to improve water quality and provide clean water to surrounding areas. This also helps to support vital processes to maintain healthy ecosystems, such as photosynthesis and the creation of living habitat for marine species."

          description: "Renewable tidal, wave and wind energy can be generated in coastal and marine habitats, providing important alternative sources of clean, reliable and affordable energy. Wind speeds can be greater and more stable in coastal and marine areas than onshore, and energy infrastructure may create artificial reefs for marine species. Renewable energy generation may also provide alternative livelihoods and support local economies."

          description: "Marine and coastal habitats provide a variety of resources and ecosystem services that can support a sustainable economy. Mangrove, coral reef, saltmarsh and seagrass habitats can support and promote sustainable livelihoods.  Small businesses in aquaculture, fisheries, tourism and recreation can create job opportunities and generate income to support local economic growth and the sustainable management of coastal resources."

          description: "Healthy coastal ecosystems are a form of reliable and cost-effective natural infrastructure. Mangrove forests and coral reefs protect coasts from floods and storm damage by reducing wave power. With climate change, the frequency and intensity of storms are predicted to increase, meaning coastal ecosystems are becoming increasingly valuable natural capital assets."

          description: "Larger income inequality within countries has been shown to be associated with greater losses of biodiversity. As hotspots of biodiversity, mangrove, goral, seagrass and saltmarsh habitats provide opportunities to reduce income and gender inequality through conservation and restoration efforts. This provides a change for greater recognition of key roles and comprehensive sustainable management to reduce biodiversity loss."

          description: "Ecosystems such as coral reefs, mangrove forests and saltmarshes provide essential ecosystem services that enable human populations to thrive.

          description: "Coastal, ‘blue carbon’ habitats such as seagrasses and mangroves help to regulate our atmosphere, sequestering and storing carbon and thereby helping to offset carbon emissions. They can also help to protect coastal communities from extreme weather events, such as storm surges. Through these actions, coastal habitats contribute to national commitments by supporting coastal communities in mitigating and adapting to climate change."

          description: "Marine and coastal habitats such as coral reefs, cold-water corals, mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrasses contain a disproportionately high amount of marine biodiversity. For instance, despite occupying <1% of the ocean, coral reefs host 25% of marine species. These ecosystems are therefore key to a healthy and thriving ocean that can continue to provide for human populations."

          description: "Mangrove forests, coral reefs, saltmarshes and seagrasses are often located where land and sea meet, playing an important role for both. In some cases, species are equally dependent on both terrestrial and marine habitats for survival. Similarly, humans live on land, yet have high dependence on marine ecosystems."

          description: "Environmental crimes, such as deforestation, habitat destruction, illegal wildlife trade and illegal, unregulated or unreported (IUU) fishing, undermine sustainable development and threaten global security. Coastal habitats, and the resources and services they provide, need to be sustainably managed. This provides opportunities to establish inclusive management regimes that balance the user needs, reduce inequality and support healthy populations."

          description: "Mangrove, coral reef, seagrass and saltmarsh habitats are rich in biodiversity and vital for sustainable development under the 2030 Agenda. They are also critical to the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, which provides a global framework for international cooperation related to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. The SDGs and Strategic Plan for Biodiversity are therefore mutually supportive and reinforcing."
