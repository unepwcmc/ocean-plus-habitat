      title: Where in the world are marine and coastal habitats?
      text:
        - Marine and coastal habitats are located throughout the world, contributing to our social, economic and cultural wellbeing. Coral reefs, seagrasses and mangroves protect our coastal communities, and provide the food and resources we require to survive.
        - Our ability to track the location and health of these important habitats over time varies globally, making it challenging to provide an accurate and complete picture. Yet, knowledge of these habitats is essential to meet many of the biodiversity and sustainable development targets set by the international community.
        - If we are missing any information for your location, please <a href='mailto:oceanplus@unep-wcmc.org' title='Send an email to the Ocean+ team'>contact us</a>!
