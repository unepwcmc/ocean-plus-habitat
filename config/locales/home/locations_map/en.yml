      title: Where are marine and coastal habitats?
      text:
        - Over 70% of the surface of Earth is ocean, comprising highly diverse marine and coastal ecosystems. These ecosystems provide a wide range of essential ecosystem services that support human society, health and the economy.
        - Our ability to track the location and health of these important habitats over time varies globally, making it challenging to provide an accurate and complete picture. Yet, knowledge of these habitats is essential to meet many of the biodiversity and sustainable development targets set by the international community.
