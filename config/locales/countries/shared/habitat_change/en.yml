        title: Change in habitat extent

        chart_text_not_available: Data not available
        smallprint: '<strong>Note:</strong> In many cases, an exact estimate of spatial change in the distribution of habitats at the national level is unknown. Changes in the availability and use of remote sensing technology is beginning to generate new data that can improve our understanding of change in extent over time.'
