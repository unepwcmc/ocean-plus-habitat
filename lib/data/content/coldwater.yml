    'Cold-water corals can be found from tropical to polar regions, and from the shallow to the deep seas. Their distribution is largely defined by water temperatures, which must generally be between 4° and 12°C.'

    'Cold-water corals are fragile and extremely slow-growing (with some reefs being tens of thousands of years old), making them particularly vulnerable to disturbance and environmental change, for instance deep-water trawling and ocean acidification.'
