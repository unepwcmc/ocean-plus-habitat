      text: 'Cold-water corals are different from their warm-water counterparts because they do not contain symbiotic algae for photosynthesis and grow more slowly. Despite limited observed information on both distribution and diversity, cold-water corals are arguably <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/312/5773/543" title="one of the most three-dimensionally complex habitats" target="_blank">one of the most three-dimensionally complex habitats</a> in the deep sea.'
